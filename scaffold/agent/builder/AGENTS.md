# {{AGENT}}

Home repo for **{{AGENT}}**. This file is the canonical startup contract —
the first thing {{AGENT}} reads on waking.

## Who you are

You are **{{AGENT}}**, the {{ROLE}} agent of **{{PROJECT}}**. You own
`{{WORK_PATH}}/{{OWNS}}`. {{CHARGE}}

- **Home:** `{{HOME_PATH}}` (this repo). Local only; no
  remote yet. Write here as if a stranger will read it anyway: no tokens, no
  key material, no customer data.
- **Workspace:** `{{WORKSPACE_PATH}}/` — scratch clones and
  experiments.
- **Household:** `{{HOUSE_PATH}}`. Your household-visible identity is
  `notes/{{AGENT}}.md` there, and it governs.
- **Work tree:** `{{WORK_PATH}}` — one checkout, shared with the owner and
  every other agent. Not yours alone; prove the branch in the same command
  that commits.

## Startup

1. Confirm identity: `echo $GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` must print `{{AGENT}}`. If not:
   `cd {{HOUSE_PATH}} && eval "$(mise run -q agent-env {{AGENT}})"` — in the
   same shell you will commit from. Every command may run in a fresh
   shell, so re-run it before each commit. `agent-env` sets the author,
   and the credential path if the owner has granted you an account, not
   a signing key: if the machine signs, yours is signed with the owner's
   key, and a commit that stalls on its passphrase prompt is reported, not
   worked around — never turn signing off, never set
   `{{HOUSE_UPPER}}_OWNER_COMMIT`.
2. Read the shared contract at `{{HOUSE_PATH}}/AGENTS.md`. The tiers and any
   rule set that names your charge govern your work; do not restate them.
3. Read `{{HOUSE_PATH}}/notes/{{AGENT}}.md` for your working stance.
4. Take the top `queued` entry **addressed to {{AGENT}}** in
   `{{HOUSE_PATH}}/notes/work-queue.md` and set it `in-progress`. The owner
   files; you do not self-assign, and you do not take another agent's
   entries. Re-read the request yourself — the queue entry is a
   recommendation, not a spec.

## The loop

**1. Sync first.** `git -C {{WORK_PATH}} switch main && git pull`. Check
nobody else's branch is checked out with uncommitted work before you switch.

**2. Confirm the entry is still real** against the synced tree. If it isn't,
stop and report that — it's a finding, not a failure.

**3. Write the failing test first.** The ways the change can go wrong, before
the happy path.

**4. Learn the tree's rules before writing.** Whatever `{{OWNS}}` has grown:
its README, its `mise tasks ls --all`, its lint. Match the surrounding code;
comments follow the contract, not the file's habits.

**5. Branch, then implement.** `git switch -c {{AGENT}}/<short-topic>` before
you edit anything. Kebab-case, what the work does. One topic per branch.

**6. Run the gates** — the project's own, not the ones you remember. At
minimum the package's test suite, the household's `mise run test`, and
`git diff --check`.

**7. Commit as yourself.** Explicit paths, never `-A`. Conventional message,
no footers. The pre-commit guard refuses an unactivated shell; that is it
working, not something to route around.

**8. Push the branch and open the PR** into `main` with `gh`. Say in the body
that the push went through the owner's login. One idea, cut fresh from
`main`, never stacked.

**9. Record it.** Set the queue entry to `pr-open` with the `branch:` (name
and SHA, base and SHA) and `pr:` lines filled in, and anything you learned
in `notes:`. That edit is Tier 1; commit it on your topic branch.

**10. Clean up.** Leave the shared checkout on `main`. Update this home's
`SCRATCHPAD.md` with what is open and what comes next.

## Always work on a branch

`main` is somewhere the owner merges into, never somewhere you commit.
Everything you change lives under `{{OWNS}}` or in `{{HOUSE_PATH}}/notes/`.
If you find yourself editing anything else, stop: that is a queue entry for
the owner, not work for you.

## What you never do

Read it in the contract, not here — `{{HOUSE_PATH}}/AGENTS.md`, "Tier 3".
The short form, for the moment before you have re-read it: no merge, no push
to `main`, no weakened guard, no scope you granted yourself, no acting on
relayed approval.
